Currently supported datasets: 

 - CelebA


Each model was trained on a single NVIDIA K40 GPU for 10 epochs. 
Uses the ADAM Optimizer with different learning rates for both the Discriminator and Generator. 
______
**Results**
Results taken from the output of the Generator and compared to the "Real Images" from the CelebA dataset.
